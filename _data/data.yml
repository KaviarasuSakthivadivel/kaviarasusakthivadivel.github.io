    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm a Software Developer and I have a particular interest in everything related to application development, APIs, Cloud & Big data.

      I'm born and brought up from a small town, So I always wanted to get out of my place and get exposed to the newer environment of higher possibilities. The urge to explore opportunities, surround me with smart people, and gain experiences that would push my limits led me to different places.
      I love coding. Especially server-side technologies. Because what matters is a small idea that can make people's lives easier.

      But that doesn't mean I'm too much of an academic-oriented guy. I believe in a balanced profile. I play badminton for my recreation. I have participated in a few inter-year tournaments in high schools as well as in college. Apart from this, traveling and meeting new people always interested me.

      I'm a self-motivated, target-oriented person, who will do whatever it takes, learn whatever it demands, to get the job done in the best possible way.
